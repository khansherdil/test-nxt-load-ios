      Tools From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia For the machine learning term,
      see test set. Test data plays a crucial role in software development by
      providing inputs that are used to verify the correctness, performance, and
      reliability of software systems. Test data encompasses various types, such
      as positive and negative scenarios, edge cases, and realistic user
      scenarios, and it aims to exercise different aspects of the software to
      uncover bugs and validate its behavior. By designing and executing test
      cases with appropriate test data, developers can identify and rectify
      defects, improve the quality of the software, and ensure it meets the
      specified requirements. Moreover, test data can also be used for
      regression testing to validate that new code changes or enhancements do
      not introduce any unintended side effects or break existing
      functionalities. Overall, the effective utilization of test data in
      software development significantly contributes to the production of
      reliable and robust software systems. Background Some data may be used in
      a confirmatory way, typically to verify that a given set of inputs to a
      given function produces some expected result. Other data may be used in
      order to challenge the ability of the program to respond to unusual,
      extreme, exceptional, or unexpected input.[1] Test data may be produced in
      a focused or systematic way (as is typically the case in domain testing),
      or by using other, less-focused approaches (as is typically the case in
      high-volume randomized automated tests). Test data may be produced by the
      tester, or by a program or function that aids the tester. Test data may be
      recorded for reuse or used only once. Test data can be created manually,
      by using data generation tools (often based on randomness[2]), or be
      retrieved from an existing production environment. The data set can
      consist of synthetic (fake) data, but preferably it consists of
      representative (real) data.[3] Limitations Due to privacy rules and
      regulations like GDPR, PCI and HIPAA it is not allowed to use privacy
      sensitive personal data for testing.[4] But anonymized (and preferably
      subsetted) production data may be used as representative data for test and
      development.[5] Programmers can also choose to generate mock data, but
      this comes with its own limitations. It is not always possible to produce
      enough fake or mock data for testing.[6] AI-generated "synthetic data" can
      be another option to generate test data. AI-powered synthetic data
      generators learn the patterns and qualities of a sample database. Once the
      training of the AI algorithm has taken place, it can produce as much or as
      little test data as defined. AI-generated synthetic data needs additional
      privacy measures to prevent the algorithm from overfitting. Some
      commercially available synthetic data generators come with additional
      privacy and accuracy controls. The amount of data to be tested is
      determined or limited by considerations such as time, cost and quality.
      Time to produce, cost to produce and quality of the test data, and
      efficiency. Domain testing Domain testing is a family of test techniques
      that focus on the test data. This might include identifying common or
      critical inputs, representatives of a particular equivalence class model,
      values that might appear at the boundaries between one equivalence class
      and another, outrageous values that should be rejected by the program,
      combinations of inputs, or inputs that might drive the product towards a
      particular set of outputs.[7] See also Software testing Unit test Test
